## 📈 **PROGRESS METRICS**

### **Overall Refactoring Progress**
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Context Service (24% of monolithic file)
- **Phase 2**: ✅ AI Instructions Service (8% of monolithic file)
- **Total Progress**: 32% of monolithic file extracted
- **Remaining**: 68% (Memory, Task, Project/Category services)

### **Code Quality Improvements**
- **Files Created**: 10 total (8 from Phase 1 + 2 from Phase 2)
- **Lines Extracted**: 1,473+ lines across all phases
- **Architecture**: Professional service-oriented design
- **Maintainability**: Significantly improved

---

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS - PHASE 3**

### **Immediate Priority**
1. **Memory Service Extraction** (~400 lines)
   - 8 CRUD operations for memory management
   - Semantic search integration
   - Embedding service integration

2. **Task Service Extraction** (~400 lines)
   - 10 CRUD operations for task management
   - Priority and deadline management
   - Status workflow handling

### **Success Criteria for Phase 3**
- Extract Memory and Task services
- Reduce monolithic file to under 2,500 lines
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Achieve 50%+ extraction progress
