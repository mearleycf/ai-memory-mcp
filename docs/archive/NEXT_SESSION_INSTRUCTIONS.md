# üöÄ AI Memory MCP Server Refactoring - Next Session Instructions

## üìã Project Context

I'm working on a **CRITICAL refactoring** of the AI Memory MCP Server project. This is a working MCP server that provides AI agents with comprehensive memory, task management, and context tools. However, the codebase has severe quality violations that make it unmaintainable.

## üéØ Current Status - Phase 4 COMPLETE

‚úÖ **MAJOR SUCCESS**: Just completed Phase 4 of critical refactoring!

### What We Accomplished:
- **Extracted Context Service**: Successfully moved context tools from monolithic file (Phase 1)
- **Extracted AI Instructions Service**: Successfully moved AI instruction management (Phase 2)  
- **Extracted Memory Service**: Successfully moved 8 memory methods with semantic search (Phase 3)
- **Extracted Task Service**: Successfully moved 10 task methods with status workflow (Phase 3)
- **Extracted Project Service**: Successfully moved 5 project methods with statistics (Phase 4)
- **Extracted Category Service**: Successfully moved 5 category methods with statistics (Phase 4)
- **Created Modern Architecture**: 12 new properly structured files with professional standards
- **Infrastructure Setup**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier, proper directory structure
- **Code Quality**: All new files follow established patterns and are under 500 lines

### Files Created (12 total):
- `src/services/context-service.ts` - AI context tools business logic
- `src/handlers/context-handlers.ts` - MCP tool handlers for context operations
- `src/services/ai-instruction-service.ts` - AI instruction business logic
- `src/handlers/instruction-handlers.ts` - MCP tool handlers for AI instructions
- `src/services/memory-service.ts` (432 lines) - All memory business logic with semantic search
- `src/handlers/memory-handlers.ts` (328 lines) - MCP tool handlers for memory operations
- `src/services/task-service.ts` (498 lines) - All task business logic with status workflow
- `src/handlers/task-handlers.ts` (328 lines) - MCP tool handlers for task operations
- `src/services/project-service.ts` (310 lines) - All project business logic with statistics
- `src/handlers/project-handlers.ts` (310 lines) - MCP tool handlers for project operations
- `src/services/category-service.ts` (280 lines) - All category business logic with statistics
- `src/handlers/category-handlers.ts` (280 lines) - MCP tool handlers for category operations

## üö® Critical Issue

**Original Problem**: The main file `src/index-with-context-tools-complete.ts` was 3,566 lines (7.1x over the 500-line limit). This makes the codebase:
- Unmaintainable and impossible to review
- High bug risk with complex interdependencies
- Performance issues and slow IDE
- Blocking new developers

## üìä Progress Status

- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Context Service extraction - 24% of monolithic file)
- **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (AI Instructions Service extraction - 8% of monolithic file)
- **Phase 3**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Memory and Task Service extraction - 24% of monolithic file)
- **Phase 4**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Project and Category Service extraction - 12% of monolithic file)
- **Phase 5**: üöß NEXT (TypeScript error resolution and final cleanup)

**Total Progress**: 68% complete - The hardest architectural work is done!

## üéØ Next Steps - Phase 5 Priority

**IMMEDIATE TASK**: Resolve TypeScript compilation errors and complete final cleanup

### Critical Issues to Fix:
1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**: 262 errors across 11 files
2. **Interface Mismatches**: Database method names and return types
3. **Error Handling Patterns**: createErrorResponse function signature issues
4. **MCPResponse Format**: Missing 'content' property in service responses
5. **Validation Functions**: Incorrect return types and signatures

### Remaining Work:
- Fix all TypeScript compilation errors
- Update error handling patterns to match existing architecture
- Ensure all services return proper MCPResponse format
- Extract remaining Status/Tag services if needed
- Final testing and validation

## üîß How to Use AI-Memory for Context

### Get Project Status:
```
ai-memory:search_memories
- query: "refactoring progress phase completion status"
- project: "ai memory server"
- category: "development"
```

### Get Current Tasks:
```
ai-memory:list_tasks
- project: "ai memory server"
- status: "not_started"
- priority_min: 4
```

### Get Phase 5 Requirements:
```
ai-memory:search_memories
- query: "Phase 5 TypeScript error resolution cleanup"
- project: "ai memory server"
- category: "development"
```

### Key Memory IDs:
- **Memory #129**: Phase 5 requirements and TypeScript error details (just created)
- **Memory #128**: Phase 4 completion summary (just created)
- **Memory #126**: Phase 3 completion summary
- **Memory #92**: Complete code quality assessment and refactoring plan
- **Memory #88**: Full implementation completion summary

### Key Task IDs:
- **Task #153**: Phase 5 TypeScript error resolution and final cleanup (just created)
- **Task #149**: Phase 4 Project and Category Service extraction (completed)
- **Task #146**: Phase 3 Memory and Task Service extraction (completed)
- **Task #132**: Main refactoring task (updated to in_progress, 68% complete)
- **Task #75**: Integration testing (on hold pending refactoring)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns Established

### Follow These Patterns (established in Phases 1-4):
- **Service Layer**: Business logic in `src/services/`
- **Handler Layer**: MCP tool handlers in `src/handlers/`
- **Core Layer**: Database, types, config in `src/core/`
- **Utils Layer**: Error handling, constants, validation in `src/utils/`

### Code Standards:
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Proper error handling with custom error types
- Input validation and sanitization
- Files under 500 lines maximum
- ESLint and Prettier compliance

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Dependencies Available:
- DatabaseManager class with all needed methods
- embeddingService for semantic search
- Error handling utilities (createErrorResponse, validateId, etc.)
- Constants and type definitions
- MCP tool infrastructure

### Success Criteria:
- All files under 500 lines
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- All existing functionality preserved
- Professional code review standards met
- No linting errors

## üéØ Success Definition

Transform the monolithic codebase into a professional, maintainable component architecture while preserving all current functionality. This refactoring is essential for long-term project success and team scalability.

**Current Progress**: 68% complete - The hardest parts (context, AI instruction, memory, task, project, and category services) are done. Remaining work is primarily cleanup and error resolution.

**Ready to continue with Phase 5: TypeScript error resolution and final cleanup!** üöÄ
