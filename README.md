# AI Memory & Task Management MCP Server

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides persistent memory and task management capabilities for AI conversations with a **normalized relational database**. Store context, preferences, and information that persists across conversations, plus manage tasks and projects with sophisticated relationship tracking.

## ðŸ†• Current Version - Normalized Database Schema

This version features a **normalized relational database** with:

- **Foreign key relationships** instead of text-based fields
- **Many-to-many tag relationships** for flexible organization
- **Project management system** with full CRUD operations
- **Category management** with usage statistics
- **Advanced relationship queries** with JOIN operations
- **Data integrity** through foreign key constraints
- **Professional architecture** with service and handler layers

## Features

### Memory Management

- **Functional Classification**: Categories represent functional purpose (technical, personal, work, etc.)
- **Auto-Creation**: Categories automatically created when referenced

### Tag Management (NEW in v2.0)

- **Normalized Tags**: Tags stored in separate table with many-to-many relationships
- **Tag Analytics**: Usage statistics across memories and tasks
- **Tag Management**: List, search, and delete unused tags
- **Smart Extraction**: Automatic extraction from comma-separated strings

## Database Architecture

### Normalized Schema (v2.0)

The database now uses a **normalized relational schema**:

```sql
-- Core Tables
memories (id, title, content, category_id, project_id, priority, created_at, updated_at)
tasks (id, title, description, status_id, category_id, project_id, priority, due_date, created_at, updated_at, completed_at, archived)

-- Reference Tables
projects (id, name, description, color, created_at, updated_at)
categories (id, name, description, created_at, updated_at)
statuses (id, name, description, is_completed_status, sort_order, created_at)
tags (id, name, created_at)

-- Junction Tables (Many-to-Many)
memory_tags (memory_id, tag_id, created_at)
task_tags (task_id, tag_id, created_at)
```

### Key Benefits

- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure consistency
- **Performance**: Optimized indexes for fast relationship queries
- **Scalability**: Normalized design eliminates data redundancy
- **Analytics**: Rich relationship data for usage statistics
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new relationships without schema changes

## Database Setup

### Prisma Database Management

The server uses Prisma for database management:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
npx prisma generate

# Push schema changes to database
npx prisma db push

# View database in Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio

# Reset database (WARNING: deletes all data)
npx prisma db push --force-reset
```

### Database Features

- **Automatic Schema Management**: Prisma handles schema migrations
- **Type Safety**: Generated TypeScript types for all database operations
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure consistency
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups recommended

## Installation

1. Navigate to the server directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/ai-memory-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up the database:

```bash
# Copy environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env with your database configuration
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name"
```

4. Initialize the database:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push database schema
npx prisma db push
```

5. Build the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Best Practices

### Organization Strategy

1. **Categories for Function**: Use categories to classify the type/purpose of information
2. **Projects for Context**: Use projects to group related work/efforts
3. **Tags for Flexibility**: Use tags for cross-cutting concerns and easy discovery
4. **Consistent Naming**: Use lowercase, hyphenated names for projects and categories

### Data Management

1. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and clean up unused tags/categories
2. **Project Lifecycle**: Archive completed projects but preserve relationships
3. **Tag Discipline**: Don't create too many similar tags - use the tag list to check existing ones
4. **Priority Usage**: Use priorities consistently to highlight important items

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues

- **Connection Issues**: Verify DATABASE_URL in your .env file
- **Schema Issues**: Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema
- **Reset Database**: Use `npx prisma db push --force-reset` (WARNING: deletes all data)

### Performance

- **Indexes**: Database includes optimized indexes for all common queries
- **Foreign Keys**: Enabled for data integrity (may slightly impact write performance)
- **Large Datasets**: System tested with thousands of memories and tasks

### Common Issues

1. **Foreign Key Errors**: Usually indicate data integrity issues - check relationships
2. **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and DATABASE_URL is correct
3. **Prisma Client**: Run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes

## Privacy and Security

- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally on your machine
- **No External Calls**: No data sent to external services
- **File Permissions**: Standard PostgreSQL database permissions apply
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups recommended for important data
