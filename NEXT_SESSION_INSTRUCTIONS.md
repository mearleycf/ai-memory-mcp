# üöÄ AI Memory MCP Server Refactoring - Next Session Instructions

## üìã Project Context

I'm working on a **CRITICAL refactoring** of the AI Memory MCP Server project. This is a working MCP server that provides AI agents with comprehensive memory, task management, and context tools. However, the codebase has severe quality violations that make it unmaintainable.

## üéØ Current Status - Phase 3 COMPLETE

‚úÖ **MAJOR SUCCESS**: Just completed Phase 3 of critical refactoring!

### What We Accomplished:
- **Extracted Memory Service**: Successfully moved 8 memory methods from a 3,276-line monolithic file
- **Extracted Task Service**: Successfully moved 10 task methods with status workflow management
- **Created Modern Architecture**: 4 new properly structured files with professional standards
- **Infrastructure Setup**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier, proper directory structure
- **Code Quality**: All new files pass strict validation and are under 500 lines

### Files Created:
- `src/services/memory-service.ts` (432 lines) - All memory business logic with semantic search
- `src/handlers/memory-handlers.ts` (328 lines) - MCP tool handlers for memory operations
- `src/services/task-service.ts` (498 lines) - All task business logic with status workflow
- `src/handlers/task-handlers.ts` (328 lines) - MCP tool handlers for task operations
- Enhanced error handling and validation utilities
- Updated `src/core/types.ts` with comprehensive interfaces

## üö® Critical Issue

**Original Problem**: The main file `src/index-with-context-tools-complete.ts` is 3,276 lines (6.5x over the 500-line limit). This makes the codebase:
- Unmaintainable and impossible to review
- High bug risk with complex interdependencies
- Performance issues and slow IDE
- Blocking new developers

## üìä Progress Status

- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Context Service extraction - 24% of monolithic file)
- **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (AI Instructions Service extraction - 8% of monolithic file)
- **Phase 3**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Memory and Task Service extraction - 24% of monolithic file)
- **Phase 4**: üöß NEXT (Project and Category Service extraction)
- **Phase 5**: ‚è≥ PENDING (Final cleanup and testing)

## üéØ Next Steps - Phase 4 Priority

**IMMEDIATE TASK**: Extract Project and Category Services from the monolithic file

### Target Files to Create:
- `src/services/project-service.ts` (~300 lines)
- `src/handlers/project-handlers.ts` (~200 lines)
- `src/services/category-service.ts` (~200 lines)

### Methods to Extract (from `src/index-with-context-tools-complete.ts`):
- **Project Service**: createProject, listProjects, getProject, updateProject, deleteProject
- **Category Service**: createCategory, getCategory, updateCategory, deleteCategory, listCategories

## üîß How to Use AI-Memory for Context

### Get Project Status:
```
ai-memory:search_memories
- query: "refactoring progress phase completion status"
- project: "ai memory server"
- category: "development"
```

### Get Current Tasks:
```
ai-memory:list_tasks
- project: "ai memory server"
- status: "not_started"
- priority_min: 4
```

### Key Memory IDs:
- **Memory #126**: Phase 3 completion summary (just created)
- **Memory #125**: Phase 2 completion summary
- **Memory #92**: Complete code quality assessment and refactoring plan
- **Memory #88**: Full implementation completion summary

### Key Task IDs:
- **Task #149**: Phase 4 Project and Category Service extraction (just created)
- **Task #146**: Phase 3 Memory and Task Service extraction (completed)
- **Task #132**: Main refactoring task (updated to in_progress)
- **Task #75**: Integration testing (on hold pending refactoring)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns Established

### Follow These Patterns (established in Phases 1, 2 & 3):
- **Service Layer**: Business logic in `src/services/`
- **Handler Layer**: MCP tool handlers in `src/handlers/`
- **Core Layer**: Database, types, config in `src/core/`
- **Utils Layer**: Error handling, constants, validation in `src/utils/`

### Code Standards:
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Proper error handling with custom error types
- Input validation and sanitization
- Files under 500 lines maximum
- ESLint and Prettier compliance

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Dependencies Available:
- DatabaseManager class with all needed methods
- embeddingService for semantic search
- Error handling utilities (createErrorResponse, validateId, etc.)
- Constants and type definitions
- MCP tool infrastructure

### Success Criteria:
- All files under 500 lines
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- All existing functionality preserved
- Professional code review standards met
- No linting errors

## üéØ Success Definition

Transform the monolithic codebase into a professional, maintainable component architecture while preserving all current functionality. This refactoring is essential for long-term project success and team scalability.

**Current Progress**: 56% complete - The hardest parts (context, AI instruction, memory, and task services) are done. Remaining extractions will be faster with established patterns.

**Ready to continue with Phase 4: Project and Category Service extraction!** üöÄ
