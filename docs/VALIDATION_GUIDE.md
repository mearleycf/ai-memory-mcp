# AI Memory MCP Server - Task Validation Guide for AI Clients

## Overview

The AI Memory MCP Server includes an intelligent task validation system designed to ensure high-quality, well-structured tasks. When creating or updating tasks, the server automatically validates your input against established quality rules and provides detailed feedback to help you improve.

## üö® Validation Rules

### 1. **No Task IDs in Titles** ‚ùå
**Rule**: Task titles should not contain ID numbers or references.

**‚ùå Invalid Examples:**
```
"Fix task #123"
"Complete Task ID 456" 
"Update task123 configuration"
"Bug id #789 in login system"
```

**‚úÖ Valid Examples:**
```
"Fix authentication bug in login component"
"Update configuration for better performance"
"Resolve database connection timeout issue"
```

**Why**: Task IDs are automatically generated by the system. Including them in titles creates confusion and redundancy.

### 2. **No Progress Updates in Descriptions** ‚ùå
**Rule**: Task descriptions should describe WHAT needs to be done, not progress or results.

**‚ùå Invalid Examples:**
```
Description: "I have completed the OAuth integration and it is working successfully. The task is now done."
Description: "Progress update: Fixed the connection pool issue and updated the configuration. Testing shows it is resolved."
```

**‚úÖ Valid Examples:**
```
Description: "Implement OAuth2 authentication using JWT tokens with proper error handling and token refresh."
Description: "Fix database connection pool timeout issues by optimizing connection parameters and retry logic."
```

**Why**: Task descriptions should remain static and describe the work to be done. Use the memory tools to document progress and outcomes.

### 3. **Specific, Actionable Titles** ‚ùå
**Rule**: Task titles should be specific and actionable, not vague.

**‚ùå Invalid Examples:**
```
"Fix"
"Update thing"
"Work on project"
"Handle issue"
```

**‚úÖ Valid Examples:**
```
"Fix authentication bug in login component"
"Update database schema for user preferences"
"Implement responsive design for mobile dashboard"
"Handle timeout errors in payment processing"
```

**Why**: Specific titles make tasks searchable, trackable, and actionable.

### 4. **Granular Task Breakdown** ‚ùå
**Rule**: Break down large tasks into smaller, specific components.

**‚ùå Invalid Examples:**
```
"Rewrite all tests for the entire application"
"Fix all bugs in the system"
"Update all components in the frontend"
"Implement all features for the complete user dashboard"
```

**‚úÖ Valid Examples:**
```
"Rewrite authentication tests for login component"
"Fix memory leak bug in data processing service"
"Update UserProfile component styling"
"Implement search bar feature for product dashboard"
```

**Why**: Granular tasks are easier to track, complete, and maintain. One task per discrete deliverable.

### 5. **Proper Project Field Usage** ‚ö†Ô∏è 
**Rule**: Use the `project` field for project organization, not the title.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Examples:**
```
Title: "Fix user-authentication module bug in login-service component"
Project: (empty)
```

**‚úÖ Better Approach:**
```
Title: "Fix authentication bug in login component"
Project: "user-authentication"
Category: "bug-fix"
```

**Why**: Proper field usage improves organization and searchability.

### 6. **Appropriate Description Length** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Rule**: Task descriptions should be concise but informative.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Examples:**
```
Description: (500+ words of detailed implementation notes)
Title: "Implement complex OAuth2 authentication system with JWT tokens"
Description: "Do it."
```

**‚úÖ Better Approach:**
```
Title: "Implement OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens"
Description: "Set up OAuth2 flow with JWT token generation, validation, and refresh mechanism. Include error handling for invalid tokens and expired sessions."
```

**Why**: Balanced descriptions provide context without overwhelming detail.

## üìù Best Practices for AI Clients

### Task Creation Structure
```json
{
  "title": "Specific, actionable description of what needs to be done",
  "description": "Context about why and how this should be implemented",
  "category": "bug-fix | feature | documentation | testing | deployment",
  "project": "project-name-here",
  "priority": 1-5,
  "tags": "comma, separated, tags",
  "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" // optional
}
```

### Good Task Examples

**üü¢ Bug Fix Task:**
```json
{
  "title": "Fix memory leak in user session management",
  "description": "Session objects are not being properly garbage collected after user logout, causing memory usage to grow over time.",
  "category": "bug-fix",
  "project": "user-auth",
  "priority": 4,
  "tags": "memory-leak, session, performance"
}
```

**üü¢ Feature Task:**
```json
{
  "title": "Add email notification for password resets",
  "description": "Implement email sending functionality that triggers when users request password resets. Include email templates and delivery confirmation.",
  "category": "feature",
  "project": "user-auth", 
  "priority": 3,
  "tags": "email, notifications, security"
}
```

**üü¢ Documentation Task:**
```json
{
  "title": "Document API rate limiting implementation",
  "description": "Create technical documentation explaining how rate limiting works, configuration options, and troubleshooting guides.",
  "category": "documentation",
  "project": "api-gateway",
  "priority": 2,
  "tags": "documentation, rate-limiting, api"
}
```

## üîÑ Handling Validation Errors

When the server rejects your task, you'll receive a detailed error response:

```
‚ùå Task validation failed:

üö® ERRORS (must be fixed):
1. Task title contains ID references. IDs are automatically generated.
   üí° Suggestion: Remove ID numbers from the title. Focus on describing what the task accomplishes.
   üìù Field: title

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNINGS (recommended fixes):
1. Title may contain project information that should be in the project field.
   üí° Suggestion: Consider moving project-related terms to the project field: user-auth, login-service

üìã Please fix the errors and resubmit. Warnings are optional but recommended.
```

### Response Strategy:
1. **Fix all errors** - These block task creation
2. **Consider warnings** - These improve task quality
3. **Resubmit** with corrections

## üéØ Progress Documentation

Instead of updating task descriptions with progress, use the memory tools:

**‚ùå Don't do this:**
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "description": "UPDATED: I implemented the OAuth flow and it's working great! Tests pass and it's ready for deployment."
}
```

**‚úÖ Do this instead:**
```javascript
// Mark task as complete
complete_task({ id: 123 })

// Document progress in memory
store_memory({
  title: "OAuth Implementation Completed Successfully",
  content: "Implemented OAuth2 flow with JWT tokens. All tests passing. Ready for deployment to staging environment.",
  category: "progress",
  project: "user-auth",
  tags: "oauth, jwt, completed, deployment-ready"
})
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Checklist

Before creating tasks, ensure:
- [ ] Title is specific and actionable
- [ ] No ID numbers in the title
- [ ] Description explains WHAT to do, not progress
- [ ] Task is granular (one deliverable per task)
- [ ] Project field is used for organization
- [ ] Category reflects the type of work
- [ ] Priority is set appropriately (1-5)

## üîß Server Configuration

The validation system runs automatically when using the **validation-enabled server**:

```bash
npm run dev-validation     # Development
npm run start-validation   # Production
```

Standard servers do not include validation rules.

## üìû Support

If you encounter validation issues:
1. Check this guide for rule explanations
2. Review the detailed error messages
3. Use the suggestions provided in error responses
4. Break down overly complex tasks into smaller components

The validation system is designed to help you create better, more maintainable tasks that improve project organization and tracking.
