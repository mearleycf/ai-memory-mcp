# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive git functionality to the MCP AI Memory tool, enabling users to perform common git operations directly through the MCP interface. The functionality will include basic git operations (branch management, staging, committing, pushing/pulling) as well as intelligent commit capabilities that analyze changes and create meaningful commit messages using AI.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and manage git branches through the MCP tool, so that I can organize my work without switching to the command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request to create a new branch THEN the system SHALL create the branch and optionally check it out
2. WHEN I request to list branches THEN the system SHALL return all local and remote branches with current branch indication
3. WHEN I request to checkout a branch THEN the system SHALL switch to the specified branch
4. WHEN I request to delete a branch THEN the system SHALL delete the branch with appropriate safety checks
5. IF a branch operation fails THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message explaining the failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to stage, commit, and push changes through the MCP tool, so that I can manage my git workflow efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request to stage files THEN the system SHALL add the specified files to the git index
2. WHEN I request to commit changes THEN the system SHALL create a commit with the provided message
3. WHEN I request to push changes THEN the system SHALL push commits to the specified remote branch
4. WHEN I request to pull changes THEN the system SHALL fetch and merge changes from the remote branch
5. WHEN I request git status THEN the system SHALL return current repository status including staged, unstaged, and untracked files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-powered intelligent commits that analyze my changes and create meaningful commit messages, so that I can maintain a clean commit history without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request an intelligent commit THEN the system SHALL analyze all staged and unstaged changes
2. WHEN analyzing changes THEN the system SHALL group related changes into logical commit units
3. WHEN generating commit messages THEN the system SHALL create conventional commit format messages
4. WHEN multiple logical groups exist THEN the system SHALL create separate commits for each group
5. IF no changes are detected THEN the system SHALL return a message indicating no changes to commit

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure git operation preferences, so that I can customize the behavior to match my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure commit message style THEN the system SHALL support both conventional and simple formats
2. WHEN I configure auto-push behavior THEN the system SHALL optionally push commits automatically after creation
3. WHEN I configure the main branch name THEN the system SHALL use the specified branch for merge operations
4. WHEN I configure AI model preferences THEN the system SHALL use the specified model for commit message generation
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with helpful messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view git history and diff information through the MCP tool, so that I can understand changes without using external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request git log THEN the system SHALL return commit history with configurable limits
2. WHEN I request diff information THEN the system SHALL show changes between commits, branches, or working directory
3. WHEN I request file history THEN the system SHALL show commit history for specific files
4. WHEN viewing diffs THEN the system SHALL format output for readability
5. IF no history exists THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle merge conflicts and advanced git operations, so that I can resolve complex git scenarios through the MCP interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a merge conflict occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and report conflicted files
2. WHEN I request to resolve conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution guidance
3. WHEN I request to abort a merge THEN the system SHALL safely abort the merge operation
4. WHEN I request to stash changes THEN the system SHALL save and restore working directory changes
5. IF git operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL detect and report the current git state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and validation, so that git operations are safe and provide clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any git operation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information
2. WHEN attempting destructive operations THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate warnings
3. WHEN repository is in an invalid state THEN the system SHALL detect and report the issue
4. WHEN network operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide connectivity-specific error messages
5. IF user lacks permissions THEN the system SHALL return permission-specific error guidance
